# Secure Deal Room

A secure deal room with encrypted negotiations powered by Fhenix FHE.

## Overview

Secure Deal Room is a Web3 platform that revolutionizes business negotiations by leveraging Fhenix's fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It allows parties to create private deal rooms where sensitive financial values like deal amounts and minimum acceptable prices remain encrypted while still enabling secure comparisons.

## Problem Statements

1. Business negotiations often fail because parties are reluctant to reveal their true price thresholds
2. Traditional deal rooms rely on trusted intermediaries to verify price matches
3. Without a secure way to compare values privately, parties operate with incomplete data
4. Current platforms can't prove offer compatibility without exposing actual values
5. Securing multiple communication channels while maintaining privacy is complex
